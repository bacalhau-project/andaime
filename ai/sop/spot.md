# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for AWS Deployment Implementation

**Objective:** Create an AWS deployment module that supports both standard EC2 and Spot instance deployments, adhering to the coding standards exemplified in the Azure and GCP deployment files. Include lightweight unit tests, mocks, and interfaces.

---

## Preparation

### 1. Review Existing Deployment Files

- [ ] **Examine Azure Deployment Code**
  - Locate the `AzureCreateDeployment` file.
  - Note the structure, coding style, and best practices used.
- [ ] **Examine GCP Deployment Code**
  - Locate the `GCPCreateDeployment` file.
  - Observe how the deployment logic is structured.
- [ ] **Identify Common Patterns**
  - Identify interfaces, naming conventions, and error handling patterns common to both.

### 2. Analyze Existing AWS Implementation

- [ ] **Review `ndiamig.go`**
  - Understand the current AWS deployment logic.
  - Note differences in format and style compared to Azure and GCP implementations.
- [ ] **Extract Reusable Components**
  - Identify any components that can be reused or need refactoring.

## Implementation Steps

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

- [ ] **Configure Project Structure**
  - Create a new branch for AWS deployment implementation.
  - Set up directories following the project's conventions.
- [ ] **Install Dependencies**
  - Ensure the AWS SDK and any other required packages are installed.
- [ ] **Initialize Testing Framework**
  - Set up the testing environment (e.g., Go's `testing` package).

### 4. Define Interfaces and Constants

- [ ] **Create Interfaces**
  - Define interfaces for AWS services similar to those in Azure and GCP deployments.
  - Example:
    ```go
    type DeploymentService interface {
        CreateInstance(config InstanceConfig) error
        // Other methods...
    }
    ```
- [ ] **Set Constants**
  - Define constants for instance types, regions, and other configurations.
  - Allow toggling between standard EC2 and Spot instances.

### 5. Implement EC2 Deployment Logic

- [ ] **Develop EC2 Deployment Functionality**
  - Write functions to handle standard EC2 instance deployment.
  - Ensure compliance with coding standards observed in Azure/GCP files.
  - Example:
    ```go
    func (svc *AWSService) CreateEC2Instance(config InstanceConfig) error {
        // Implementation...
    }
    ```
- [ ] **Handle Error Cases**
  - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
  - Use consistent error messages and logging levels.

### 6. Implement Spot Instance Deployment Logic

- [ ] **Develop Spot Instance Functionality**
  - Write functions to handle Spot instance requests and lifecycle.
  - Include logic for handling Spot interruptions and bidding strategies.
- [ ] **Integrate with Deployment Interface**
  - Ensure Spot instance deployment aligns with the defined interfaces.

### 7. Follow Coding Standards

- [ ] **Maintain Consistent Style**
  - Use the same naming conventions, indentation, and commenting style as in Azure/GCP files.
- [ ] **Modularize Code**
  - Break down code into reusable packages and modules.
- [ ] **Document Functions**
  - Add comments and documentation for all exported functions and types.

## Testing

### 8. Write Unit Tests

- [ ] **Set Up Test Files**
  - Create test files, e.g., `aws_deployment_test.go`.
- [ ] **Write Tests for EC2 Deployment**
  - Test successful deployment scenarios.
  - Test failure cases and error handling.
- [ ] **Write Tests for Spot Instance Deployment**
  - Test Spot instance requests and interruption handling.
- [ ] **Ensure Test Coverage**
  - Aim for a high percentage of code coverage (e.g., 80%+).

### 9. Implement Mocks

- [ ] **Create Mock Services**
  - Develop mock implementations of AWS services.
  - Use interfaces to inject mocks into your functions.
- [ ] **Use Mocks in Unit Tests**
  - Replace actual AWS SDK calls with mocks during testing.
  - Verify that functions behave correctly with mocked responses.

### 10. Run and Validate Tests

- [ ] **Execute Unit Tests**
  - Run all tests using the testing framework.
  - Ensure all tests pass successfully.
- [ ] **Fix Issues**
  - Address any failing tests or coverage gaps.

## Code Review and Refinement

### 11. Perform Code Review

- [ ] **Self-Review Code**
  - Check for adherence to coding standards.
  - Ensure code is clean, well-documented, and efficient.
- [ ] **Peer Review**
  - Request a code review from team members.
  - Incorporate feedback as necessary.

### 12. Refactor Code

- [ ] **Optimize Implementations**
  - Simplify complex functions.
  - Remove redundant code.
- [ ] **Enhance Readability**
  - Improve variable names and function signatures.
  - Ensure comments are clear and helpful.

### 13. Update Documentation

- [ ] **Write Usage Guides**
  - Document how to use the AWS deployment module.
- [ ] **Update README**
  - Add information about the new AWS deployment capabilities.

---

## Integration and Deployment

### 14. Integration Testing

- [ ] **Test with Actual AWS Services**
  - Deploy test instances to AWS.
  - Verify that both EC2 and Spot instances are created successfully.
- [ ] **Validate End-to-End Workflow**
  - Ensure the deployment integrates seamlessly with other system components.

### 15. Merge Changes

- [ ] **Prepare for Merge**
  - Resolve any merge conflicts with the main branch.
- [ ] **Conduct Final Review**
  - Double-check all changes and tests.
- [ ] **Merge Code**
  - Merge the feature branch into the main branch following project protocols.

### 16. Deploy to Production

- [ ] **Monitor Deployment**
  - Observe the deployment process for any issues.
- [ ] **Verify Production Functionality**
  - Ensure that the deployment works in the production environment.

## Post-Implementation

### 17. Monitor and Support

- [ ] **Set Up Monitoring**
  - Implement logging and monitoring for deployments.
- [ ] **Handle Issues**
  - Be prepared to address any post-deployment bugs or issues.

### 18. Gather Feedback

- [ ] **Collect User Feedback**
  - Get input from team members and users on the new deployment module.
- [ ] **Plan Enhancements**
  - Identify areas for future improvement.
