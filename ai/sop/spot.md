# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for AWS Direct Resource Provisioning

**Objective:** Migrate from AWS CDK to direct AWS SDK resource provisioning for EC2 instances, networking, and associated resources. This will simplify the deployment process and reduce dependencies.

---

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning ✓

### 1. Review Current Implementation
- [x] Identify all CDK dependencies in the codebase
- [x] Document current resource creation workflow
- [x] Map CDK constructs to equivalent AWS SDK calls

### 2. Design New Architecture
- [x] Design direct AWS SDK resource provisioning flow
- [x] Plan migration strategy with minimal service disruption
- [x] Define new interfaces for AWS resource management

---

## Phase 2: Implementation

### 3. Remove CDK Dependencies ✓
- [x] Remove CDK-specific code and imports
- [x] Update go.mod to remove CDK dependencies
- [x] Clean up CDK-related configuration files

### 4. Implement Direct Resource Creation

#### VPC and Networking ✓
- [x] Implement VPC creation using AWS SDK
- [x] Add subnet configuration and creation
- [x] Configure route tables and internet gateway
- [x] Implement security group management

#### EC2 Instance Management ✓
- [x] Create EC2 instance provisioning logic
- [x] Implement instance state management
- [x] Add instance metadata handling
- [x] Configure instance networking

#### Resource Tagging and Management ✓
- [x] Implement resource tagging strategy
- [x] Add resource lifecycle management
- [x] Create cleanup and termination logic

### 5. Error Handling and Logging ✓
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [x] Add detailed logging for resource operations
- [x] Create recovery mechanisms for failed operations

---

## Phase 3: Testing

### 6. Unit Testing ✓
- [x] Create unit tests for new AWS SDK implementations
- [x] Update existing tests to remove CDK dependencies
- [x] Verify error handling and edge cases

### 7. Integration Testing ✓
- [x] Test complete resource provisioning workflow
- [x] Verify network connectivity and security
- [x] Test resource cleanup and termination

### 8. Performance Testing ✓
- [x] Measure resource creation time
- [x] Compare memory and CPU usage
- [x] Verify scalability under load

---

## Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment

### 9. Update Documentation ✓
- [x] Update API documentation
- [x] Create migration guide for users
- [x] Document new configuration options
